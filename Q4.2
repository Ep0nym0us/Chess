DIY Market Research
(note: very informal)



Chess.com
URL: https://www.chess.com/

Pro: It is very straight forward (doesn't make me think)
Pro: little noise or clutter
Pro: it is self evident on how it works and what its for (I mean look at the name)




Lichess.org
URL: https://lichess.org/

Pro: very straight forward.
      Note for the homescreen - It doesn't make me think too much, does assume you know a bit about chess on the index page, but has easy to see links to teach people how to play and practice modes.
Pro: A tiny bit of clutter, but basically clutter free, just a slightly weird layout for the index page (at first glance).
Pro: it is self explanatory, 
      Again fro the homescreen - but does assume some chess knowledge, though (again) it has easy to see links to teach beginners.



MathIsFun Chess
https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/chess.html

Pro: it doesn't make me think too much
Pro/Con: though fairly little noise it is definitely not aesthetically pleasing and some ui elements are in odd places
Pro: it is quite self explanatory and simple, but also lacking in features.
