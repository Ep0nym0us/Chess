Plan of Action;

1) We need to seperate the logic of the chessboard and that of the game logic.
2) The board will only receive the valid moves and then allow the user to only drag drop 
3) Messages will then be sent to the server who will then send it to the other player
4) The play button is interactive and will allow the player to access the game
5) The pieces will all be interactive and allow for drag and drop
